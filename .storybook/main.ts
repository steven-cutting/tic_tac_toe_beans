/**
 * The component workshop.
 *
 * Storybook renders one component at a time, in every state its surface names,
 * with axe over each render — which is how a component gets built when the
 * route that will host it does not exist yet, and how every state of one that
 * does gets looked at without playing until the game produces it.
 *
 * `just storybook` serves it and `just storybook-build` proves it still
 * compiles; `.github/workflows/pages.yml` never sees it, and `just chromatic`
 * is what publishes a build of it for visual review.
 *
 * Stories live in a root-level `stories/` directory rather than beside the
 * components, for the same reason `tests/` does: a component's source stays one
 * file, and evidence of a given kind is found where that kind of evidence
 * lives.

   * The platform's own workshop, shown beside this one rather than rebuilt
   * here: its components, and the token sheet this game does not keep. Its
   * address is the one thing about it recorded upstream — pasted here because
   * this block has to run as it stands — and `docs/project/platform.md` is the
   * way to the page that records it.
   *
   * `expanded: false` because this game's own components belong at the top of
   * its own sidebar.
   *
   * This is the one thing in `just check` that reaches the network. Storybook
   * checks a ref while it builds by fetching the address's `iframe.html`, and
   * an address it cannot reach becomes a ref marked unknown rather than a
   * failure — so gate 6 degrades to a sidebar entry that does not open, and
   * passes either way. The cost is stated as behaviour rather than a count:
   * `checkRef` fetches once, and on a response it reads the same file a second
   * time as JSON to tell a workshop from a login page, so an address that
   * answers costs two requests and one that does not costs one. The story run
   * never fetches at all — `getRefs` returns nothing under the test runner
   * before any address is read.
   * `docs/reference/quality-gates.md` states the exception, and decision 0008
   * is why it was taken.

   * list is a 403, and a story that will not load is a workshop that shows
   * nothing. Storybook's builder appends this `configDir` itself, which is why
   * `.storybook/preview.ts` already served and `stories/` did not.
   *
   * `mergeConfig` concatenates arrays, so this entry survives the config
   * SvelteKit's plugin merges on top of it. A directory rather than a file,
   * which covers a helper module beside the `*.stories.svelte` as well.
   *
   * Dev only: `fs.allow` guards nothing else. `storybook build` bundles the same
   * files through Rollup and the story run resolves them through Vitest, which
   * allows the project root, so both gates stayed green while `just storybook`
   * served none of them.
