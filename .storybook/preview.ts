/*
 * Appearance globals.
 *
 * `appearance.allium`'s Appearance surface, which `@steven-cutting/biscuit-games`
 * ships, derives `dark_active` and `animations_active` from the stored settings
 * and from the device. The toolbar below makes those inputs adjustable so a
 * component can be built and inspected in every combination of theme and high
 * contrast before the route that sets them exists.
 *
 * The stylesheet keys every palette on `:root` — the documentElement of the
 * preview iframe. A decorator that wrapped the story in a
 * `<div data-theme="dark">` would set the attribute on an element none of those
 * selectors match, so the writes go to the document root and nowhere else.
 *
 * This is Storybook infrastructure standing in for the host document, not the
 * application expressing a preference, so it needs no port. The application
 * does need one, and the platform ships it: a route that lets the player choose
 * reads the device through the platform's preferences port and writes these
 * same three attributes from what it says — see `docs/explanation/layering.md`.
