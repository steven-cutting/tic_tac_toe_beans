/**
 * The story run: every story rendered in real Chromium, with axe over each one
 * and the play functions executed as interaction tests.
 *
 * This is a file of its own rather than a second project inside `vite.config.ts`,
 * and that is what protects the coverage floor. Vitest 4 has no per-project
 * coverage — `coverage` is a `NonProjectOptions` member — and
 * `@vitest/coverage-v8` merges every project that ran into one map before it
 * checks the thresholds. A story project sharing a run with the unit project
 * would therefore raise the number measured over `src/lib/**` without adding an
 * assertion. Here there is no coverage block at all, and `npm run coverage`
 * pins `--config vite.config.ts`, so the run that measures the floor never
 * loads this file. `vitest.config.ts` names both as projects, but nothing runs
 * it with coverage enabled.
 *
 * `sveltekit()` is listed explicitly because `storybookTest` supplies no Svelte
 * compiler: it hands the framework presets a bare `{ root }` object, and
 * `@storybook/svelte-vite` only appends a docgen plugin to whatever it is given.
 * The compiler and the `$lib` alias have to come from the config this run loads.
 *
 * `svelteTesting()` is deliberately not listed. It exists to make jsdom behave,
 * and its Vitest-gated hook would push a Testing Library cleanup setup file into
 * a browser run that has no use for it.

   * Named so the optimiser resolves it before the run rather than during it.
   * A dependency Vite meets for the first time inside a story is prebundled on
   * the spot, and prebundling reloads the page: the run that was already under
   * way loses its module graph mid-render and reports a heap of
   * `Cannot read properties of undefined` from inside Svelte's own DOM
   * operations. It is a cold-cache failure, so it clears on a second run
   * locally and never clears in CI, where every cache is cold — which is the
   * worst shape a failure can have. Vite asks for this list by name when it
   * happens.
