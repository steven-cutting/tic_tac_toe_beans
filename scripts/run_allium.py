"""Run an Allium subcommand over docs/specs/ and assert that it reported nothing.

Neither subcommand's exit code carries what this project means by clean, so
neither can be the gate on its own.

`allium check` exits 0 on an `info` diagnostic. `allium.field.unused` is one, so
the waiver `game.allium` used to carry for it was never what kept the recipe
green -- the exit code would have been 0 either way. The modules carry no waiver
at all now, and that changes nothing here: an `info` still exits 0, and this
script is what refuses it. `allium analyse` fails the other direction:
it keys its exit code on findings alone and ignores diagnostics entirely, so a
module that does not parse passes it, with the `error` sitting in the JSON it
has just printed.

The contract in docs/how-to/work-with-the-specs.md is that every module reports
an empty `diagnostics` array and an empty `findings` array. That is what this
reads, and the only thing it asserts. The tool's own output is still printed
whole: the JSON belongs to allium, and only the verdict is ours.
