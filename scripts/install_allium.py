"""Install the pinned Allium command-line tool into `.tools/bin`.

`allium` is a Rust binary rather than a package, so neither lockfile can name
it. The version and the checksum of every artefact are pinned here instead,
beside the URL they pin -- the same shape as `LYCHEE_VERSION` sitting beside its
`rev` in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

The install directory is ignored by Git on purpose. `just check` snapshots the
worktree between recipes, so a binary Git can see would abort the run before any
recipe's exit code is read.
