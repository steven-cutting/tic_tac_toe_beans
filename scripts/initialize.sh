# Hooks are installed only from the primary checkout. Every worktree of this
# repository shares one .git/hooks directory, and `prek install` writes a shim
# naming an absolute path into whichever worktree ran it — so a hook installed
# from a secondary worktree runs that worktree's virtual environment for commits
# made anywhere, and keeps doing so after the worktree is deleted, at which point
# every commit fails on a `prek` that is not on PATH. The comparison is the test
# git itself uses: in a secondary worktree the common directory and the git
# directory differ.
