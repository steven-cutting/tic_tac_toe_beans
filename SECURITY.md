# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report suspected vulnerabilities privately, through GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting on this repository. Please do not open a public issue for anything you believe
is exploitable.

GitHub offers that form on public repositories. While this repository is private, only
people its owner has added can see it at all, so report to the owner directly instead —
the account named in this repository's address. Do not open an issue.

Include what you did, what happened, and what you expected. A link that reproduces the
behaviour is worth more than a description of it.

## Supported versions

The deployed site is built from `main`. There are no released versions to support and no
backports: a fix lands on `main` and deploys.

## What is in scope

- Anything that lets one visitor affect another, if such a thing existed.
- Credential material committed to the repository.
- A dependency or GitHub Action that has been tampered with, or a lockfile that does not
  match its manifest.
- A flaw in the workflow permissions that would let a build publish something it should
  not.

## Out of scope

- Denial of service against GitHub Pages.
- Anything a person can do to their own browser.

## What this project already does

- No server, no accounts, no database, and no data collected about anyone. Nothing leaves
  the browser.
- No external scripts, fonts or images at runtime.
- Every dependency pinned to an exact version and locked; `just lock-check` fails if a
  manifest and its lockfile disagree.
- Every GitHub Action pinned to a commit SHA rather than a mutable tag.
- Continuous integration runs with `contents: read` and `packages: read`, the second so
  the install can read the design system package. Only the Pages deployment holds write
  scopes, in its own workflow file.
- `ripsecrets` scans every commit, with its output suppressed so a match never copies the
  matched value into a log.

The reasoning behind all of this is in
[Security model](docs/explanation/security-model.md).
