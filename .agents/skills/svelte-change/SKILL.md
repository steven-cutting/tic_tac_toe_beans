description: Implement or review a Svelte route or component change with accessibility, rendering, and port-boundary evidence.

# Change a route or component

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and `docs/explanation/architecture.md`. Identify which state is derived at build time by prerendering and which is client state held in a rune.
2. Inspect the route, the component, the ports under `src/lib/ports/` and the two `@steven-cutting/biscuit-games` exports — the device's preferences and its keyboard — and the existing tests before editing. Never reach for `localStorage`, `crypto`, `Date` or any other browser global outside a port adapter.
3. Use Svelte 5 runes: `$props` for inputs, `$state` for local state, `$derived` for computed values. Pass callbacks as props rather than dispatching events.
4. Preserve semantic HTML, labels bound to controls, keyboard operation, visible focus, and a non-colour indication for every state a surface shows.
5. Add Testing Library evidence in `tests/`. Render against the fakes from `src/lib/ports/`, and against `createFakePreferences` and `createFakeKeys` from `@steven-cutting/biscuit-games` for the two ports the package owns, rather than stubbing globals; assert through accessible roles and names.
6. Add a story in `stories/` covering each state the governing surface names, and say in its documentation which surface and which `@guarantee` clauses it stands for, by name. A story is a fixture, not an assertion; where a guarantee is about interaction, prove it with a play function. Inject port fakes there too — the story run is a real browser, so a global would work, which is exactly why it stays forbidden.
7. Keep the coverage floor: `src/lib/**` is measured by the jsdom suite alone, so a new component needs a test in the same change. A story never counts towards it.
8. Run `just frontend-static`, `just frontend-unit` and `just storybook-test`, then `just check` before handoff.
