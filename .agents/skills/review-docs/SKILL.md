# Add or revise a documentation page

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and `docs/reference/documentation-contract.md`. The contract is enforced by `scripts/validate_docs.py`, which reports every violation at once.
2. Find the topic's owner first. Every topic in `docs/manifest.yml` has exactly one canonical page, so prefer editing the owning page over writing a new one.
3. Say which side of the template the page is on. A managed page is changed in `biscuit_games_template` and arrives by `copier update`; editing it here is a stopgap the next update will merge. A seed page is this game's and no update touches it. `docs/how-to/update-from-template.md` lists both.
4. A new page needs a `docs/manifest.yml` entry whose `title`, `kind`, `audience`, `canonical_for` and `requires` match the page frontmatter exactly, including list order — the comparison is order-sensitive.
5. Give the page one level-one heading identical to its `title`, at least forty words of substance, and no unfinished markers or placeholder prose.
6. Link the page in from `docs/README.md`, directly or transitively. An unreachable page fails the contract even when everything else about it is correct.
7. Use relative links and check the case; the contract verifies link targets exist with exact case, and heading anchors within Markdown targets.
8. Run `just check-docs`, then `just check` before handoff.
