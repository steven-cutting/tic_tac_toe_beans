# The specifications, checked mechanically rather than by review: syntax,
# references, and names a module reaches for that no import defines. Every
# module must report an empty `diagnostics` array; anything reported is a
# regression. Waiver terms: docs/how-to/work-with-the-specs.md.
#
# The wrapper is what asserts that, because neither subcommand's exit code
# does. `allium check` exits 0 on an `info` diagnostic and `allium analyse`
# ignores diagnostics altogether, so both recipes read the JSON instead of
# trusting the status. Both need the pinned binary, which `just initialize`
# installs and `just install-allium` repairs.
