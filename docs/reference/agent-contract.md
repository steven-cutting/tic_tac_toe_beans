# Agent contract

Enforced by `scripts/validate_agents.py`, run by `just check-agents` and by a pre-commit
hook. `AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth for how an agent works in this
repository; everything else in the agent surface exists only so a particular tool can
find it.

## The four surfaces

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Canonical. Read natively by Codex, and by anything following the convention. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | A pointer, byte-pinned to `@AGENTS.md` and nothing else. |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | A pointer, byte-pinned to one paragraph. |
| `.agents/skills/` | Canonical task procedures, mirrored by thin bridges under `.claude/skills/` and `.codex/skills/`. |

A `CODEX.md` at the repository root is forbidden: Codex reads `AGENTS.md` directly, and a
second file would be a second source of truth.

## What `AGENTS.md` must contain

- At least 300 words.
- Six phrases, each naming an invariant that is expensive to rediscover: `untrusted`,
  `just check`, `explicit authorization`, `ai_tmp/`, `docs/specs/`, and `runes`.

The phrase list is a crude check and is meant to be. It does not verify that the guidance
is good; it verifies that the six topics were not dropped in an edit.

## What a skill must be

This game carries eight canonical skills, one directory each under `.agents/skills/`.

Frontmatter of exactly two keys:

```markdown
---
name: svelte-change
description: Implement or review a Svelte route or component change with accessibility, rendering, and port-boundary evidence.
---
```

- `name` equals the directory name.
- `description` is at least eight words and states a real trigger.
- The body cites `AGENTS.md` and names at least one `just` recipe. A procedure that ends
  without saying how to verify it is not a procedure.

The frontmatter parser is deliberately literal. It splits every line between the `---`
markers on the first colon and treats a line without one as an error, so a blank line
inside the block fails the check with `invalid frontmatter line`. Keep the two keys
adjacent, with nothing between them. The same parser reads the bridges, so the rule holds
there too.

A key that appears twice is an error rather than an overwrite. Left to the usual last-wins
behaviour, a block of three lines would satisfy a rule about two keys on whichever copy
happened to survive, which is the opposite of what "exactly two" is for.

## What a bridge must be

Each of `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and `.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` carries the
canonical frontmatter verbatim, then exactly this sentence and nothing else:

```markdown
Follow `../../../.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. That file is canonical and this bridge adds nothing to it.
```

The body is compared against that template rather than measured against a word budget. A
budget was the earlier rule and it enforced the wrong thing: a bridge could carry an
instruction of its own — an extra step, a caveat, a second pointer — and pass on being
brief. This is an instruction surface, so a clause smuggled into it is read as guidance and
becomes a second source of truth for the skill it points at. A bridge that grows content
fails whether or not it is short.

## The inventory

The validator lists managed files from Git, honouring only this repository's
`.gitignore`, and compares that against what it expects.

- Every expected file must exist. A skill without its two bridges fails.
- No unexpected file may exist under `.agents/`, `.claude/` or `.codex/`. The single
  exception is `.claude/settings.json`, which is tolerated but not required — it carries
  provider configuration rather than agent guidance.
- Managed files must be regular files, never symlinks.

Local assistant state stays out of the inventory by being listed in `.gitignore`. That is
deliberate: the check reads Git rather than walking the filesystem, so an ignored file is
invisible to it.
