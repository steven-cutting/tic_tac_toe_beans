# Work in the component workshop

The workshop is Storybook, served locally. It renders one component at a time, in every
state its surface names, in either palette, with the accessibility check running as you
go. It is where the remaining surfaces get built. Why it exists is in
[Decision 0005](../decisions/0005-component-workshop.md).

## Run it

```console
just storybook
```

The workshop opens on port 6006 with hot module replacement, the same as `just dev`.

To render every story in Chromium and run axe over each one:

```console
just storybook-test
```

The same run is available from the workshop itself: **Run tests** at the foot of the
sidebar, with interactions, coverage and accessibility as separate toggles, marks each story
in the sidebar as it finishes. It is the same story suite the recipe runs — the panel starts
its own Vitest, which is why `vitest.config.ts` exists — but `just check` reads the recipe,
so the button is for working, not for evidence.

Both `just storybook-build` and `just storybook-test` are part of `just check`, so a story
that stops rendering, or a component that picks up an accessibility violation, fails the
gate rather than waiting to be noticed.

## Install the browser

The story run needs a real Chromium, which is in neither lockfile.

```console
just storybook-browsers
```

This downloads a browser over the network into a cache outside the repository. It is the
one thing here that cannot run offline at all. `just initialize` does it for you; run it
again by hand after the `playwright` pin moves. On Linux, `just storybook-browsers-deps`
installs the system libraries Chromium links against.

## The platform's workshop, beside this one

`.storybook/main.ts` carries a `refs` entry for the platform's published workshop, so its
components — and the token sheet the platform keeps — appear under **Biscuit Games** in the
sidebar, collapsed, below this game's own. They are served from where the platform
publishes them; nothing is built here.

Storybook checks the address while it builds, so `just storybook-build` reaches the network
on every run of the gate — and cannot fail on it, because an unreachable address becomes an
entry that does not open rather than an error. What that costs, and the exception it makes
to the gate, are in [Quality gates](../reference/quality-gates.md); the story run never
fetches at all.

## Where stories live

Stories live in `stories/` at the repository root, one file per component. The layout rule
and what the story run proves are in [Testing](../reference/testing.md).

Every file here covers one component this game owns. The design tokens have a specimen sheet
of their own, and it is the platform's rather than this repository's — the tokens are
consumed by every component and owned by none of them. What each pair of them measures is
held by the platform's own test, not by one here.

## Write a story

Svelte CSF means the story file is itself a Svelte component. Call `defineMeta` in a module
script, destructure the `Story` component out of what it returns, and write one `Story`
element per state.

```svelte
<script module lang="ts">
  import { defineMeta } from '@storybook/addon-svelte-csf';

  import Lockup from '../src/lib/components/Lockup.svelte';

  const { Story } = defineMeta({ title: 'Brand/Lockup', component: Lockup, tags: ['autodocs'] });
</script>

<!-- The comment above a story becomes its description on the docs page. -->
<Story name="Beside the platform's words" />
```

Imports reach into `src/` with a relative path, matching `tests/`.

Four rules on top of the format:

1. **Name the states the surface names.** A story set is a reading of the specification, so
   cover the states `docs/specs/` says the surface has, and say which surface and which
   `@guarantee` clauses it stands for. Cite them by name; the words live in one place.
2. **A story is a fixture, not an assertion.** The evidence still lives in `tests/`, and the
   coverage floor is still earned there.
3. **Inject port fakes, never touch a browser global.** The story run is a real browser, so
   `localStorage` and the clipboard exist and would work. That is exactly why the rule
   holds: construct the component against the fakes in `src/lib/ports/`, which `tests/`
   uses too, and the two the platform package ships, `createFakePreferences` and
   `createFakeKeys`.
4. **Reach for a play function when the guarantee is about interaction.** A story that tabs
   to a key and activates it is executable evidence for `FullyKeyboardOperable` in a way a
   rendered picture is not.

A story that needs composition — a wrapper, a sibling, children of its own — either sets
`asChild` and supplies children, which ignores args, or supplies a snippet named `template`,
which receives the args and the story context. The addon's own documentation covers both.

## Switch theme, contrast and motion

The toolbar carries four globals. Theme and high contrast set `data-theme` and
`data-high-contrast` on the preview's root element, which is what the design system's
stylesheet keys on, so a story sees the tokens the application will. The animations
setting and reduced motion decide `data-animations` between them, and the device wins: the
attribute is written only while animations are on and motion is not reduced. A story pins
a value with a `globals` prop, which beats the toolbar and disables the matching control.

Reduced motion is a simulation, labelled as one: it freezes declarative motion in the
preview but cannot make the browser report the preference, and a fresh game has none.

Check both palettes before you finish. Colour never carries meaning alone here, and high
contrast changes which colours carry it — see
[Accessibility](../explanation/accessibility.md).

## When the accessibility check fails

The accessibility panel names the axe rule that failed and the node that failed it. The
story run fails on a violation because `.storybook/preview.ts` sets the addon's test mode
to error; its own default only reports.

1. **Fix the component, not the story.** A story is a fixture; turning a rule off to make
   one pass leaves the defect in the application and deletes the report.
2. **A missing or wrong accessible name is a test failure too.** It is the same information
   a role-and-name query matches on, so add the assertion in `tests/` while you are there.
3. **A contrast failure is usually a token, not a component.** Check the light palette, the
   dark palette and high contrast in the stylesheet `@steven-cutting/biscuit-games` ships
   before changing any markup — and note that a token fault is repaired upstream and taken
   here as a version, not edited in `node_modules`. See
   [The platform upstream](../project/platform.md).
4. **Silence is not always a pass.** Axe skips what it cannot attribute, including anything
   behind `aria-hidden` — the monogram beside the lockup's words is not checked by the
   contrast rule at all. Measure by hand when a guarantee rests on something the tool does
   not report.
5. **If a rule is genuinely wrong for this project**, configure it once, where the
   configuration lives, with a stated reason. The rule about suppressions does not bend for
   this tool; see [Quality philosophy](../explanation/quality-philosophy.md).

## Publish it for visual review

Axe answers whether a rule is broken. Whether the thing looks right is a different
question, and it is answered by comparing the render against the last accepted one, in
Chromatic. Why, and what it costs, is in
[Decision 0006](../decisions/0006-visual-review-in-chromatic.md).

**On a pull request**, comment:

```text
/chromatic
```

That publishes the branch and replies with a link. It is deliberately something you ask
for, so a change that touches no component spends nothing. It has to be the whole word, on
a pull request whose branch lives in this repository, from someone whose repository
permission is write or better — a fork's pull request is refused, for the reason
[the security model](../explanation/security-model.md) gives. A 🚀 on your comment means it
was accepted; silence means one of those checks said no, and the reason is a notice on the
run. The workflow also has to be on `main` before the comment does anything at all.

**From a laptop**, with the project token exported:

```console
export CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN=…
just chromatic
```

The recipe builds the workshop and publishes it. It is not part of `just check` — it needs
the network and a token, so it sits beside `just check-links-online` rather than in the
gate. It takes one optional argument, the branch name, which only CI passes: it checks a
pull request out at a detached head and Chromatic would otherwise have no branch to file
the build under.

A visual change never fails the run. It is recorded for you to look at and accept in
Chromatic, and a push to `main` accepts its own changes, so the baseline follows the branch
without anyone maintaining it. The corollary is worth holding on to: a regression that gets
merged becomes the baseline. The review is the pull request, and there is no second one.
