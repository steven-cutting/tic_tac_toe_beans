# Test and debug

## Run the suites

```console
just frontend-unit        # Vitest, once
just frontend-coverage    # Vitest with the coverage floor enforced
just frontend-static      # ESLint, Prettier check, svelte-check
just storybook-test       # every story in Chromium, with axe over each
```

To iterate on one file, call Vitest directly:

```console
npx vitest tests/lockup.test.ts
npx vitest --watch tests/ports.test.ts
```

Framework configuration and conventions are described in
[Testing](../reference/testing.md); this page is about narrowing down a failure.

## Narrow down a failing test

1. Run the single file first. A failure that only appears in the whole suite is usually
   shared state, and there is very little of it here — the ports are constructed per
   test.
2. If a component assertion fails, read the DOM that Testing Library prints. It shows the
   accessible names, which is what the queries match on.
3. If the expectation is about a rule, work it through by hand against the module under
   `docs/specs/` that states it. The specification is the arbiter, not the current code.
4. Do not weaken an assertion to make it pass. If the specification is wrong, change the
   specification — see [Work with the specifications](work-with-the-specs.md).

## Debug a coverage failure

`just frontend-coverage` prints the uncovered lines per file. Two cases look alike and are
not:

- **Untested behaviour.** Add the test. This is the common case.
- **Unreachable code.** A defensive branch no input can reach, or a Svelte-compiled
  update branch for a value that never changes. Remove the branch rather than inventing
  a test that reaches it artificially.

Never lower the threshold in `vite.config.ts`.

## Debug a browser problem

There is no server, so the browser and the build output are the whole system.

```console
BASE_PATH=/<repository name> just frontend-build
BASE_PATH=/<repository name> just preview
```

The base path goes on both commands, so the preview sits where Pages serves. See
[Configuration](../reference/configuration.md).

If something works under `just dev` but not under `just preview`, suspect prerendering:
module-scope work runs once at build time, and anything per-visitor must happen in the
browser.
