# Decision 0007: A project-managed Allium binary

*Carried from Poodl's decision 0011 at `0a46a485`, and restated for a game rendered from the Biscuit Games template. Poodl's own record stands where it is.*

## Context

The specifications under `docs/specs/` decide every behaviour in this project, so something
has to confirm mechanically that they parse and analyse cleanly, rather than leaving
modules that outrank the code to be read by eye. `allium` is the tool that checks them.

`allium` is a Rust binary published by [`juxt/allium-tools`][upstream]. It is not a package
either lockfile can name, which is the whole difficulty: this repository pins every
dependency exactly and proves the pins with `just lock-check`.

Two packages share the name and are not this tool. On PyPI, `allium-cli` is a client for
the Allium *blockchain data* APIs. On npm, `allium` is a Gherkin parser. Neither has any
relationship to the specification language, and adding either would be a supply-chain
mistake wearing the right name.

## Decision

Install the prebuilt release binary, pinned by version and by SHA-256, into a gitignored
`.tools/bin/`. `scripts/install_allium.py` holds the version, the release URL and the
checksum of each supported artefact, and `just install-allium` runs it. `just check-specs`
and `just analyse-specs` run the result.

The pin sits in the script beside the URL it pins, which is the shape
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` already uses for `lychee`: the version travels with the thing it
describes rather than in a manifest with no second reader.

`cargo install allium-cli` was the alternative. It was rejected because it drags a third
toolchain into a repository that already pays deliberately for an unusual second one — see
[decision 0004](0004-python-toolchain.md) — and compiles from source on every cold runner.
A 1.6 MB download with a checksum is cheaper and proves more.

## Consequences

The binary is not in either lockfile, so `just lock-check` cannot speak for it. This is the
same shape as the Chromium build the story tests render in: a versioned artefact that
`just initialize` installs and a documented procedure keeps current. The procedure is in
[Maintain dependencies](../how-to/maintain-dependencies.md).

Checksums have to be produced by hand, because upstream publishes none that cover these
files. The release's own `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists only the editor extension and the language
server, and the Homebrew formula fills in two of the four unix targets and leaves the
`x86_64` entries as empty strings — `x86_64` Linux being exactly what continuous
integration runs on. The four recorded values were computed by downloading each artefact;
the two Homebrew does publish match. Moving the version means recomputing all four.

`.tools/` must stay ignored by Git. `just check` snapshots the worktree between recipes, so
a binary Git could see would abort the run before any recipe's exit code was read.

Both recipes are gates: hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` triggered by `docs/specs/`
and by the pin itself, steps in the `documents` CI job, and gates 10 and 11 of
`just check`.

Gating took more than a line in the `Justfile`, because no exit code here carries the
verdict. `allium check` exits non-zero on warnings as well as errors but 0 on an `info`
diagnostic, and `allium analyse` keys its status on findings alone and ignores diagnostics
entirely, so a module that fails to parse passes it with the `error` in the JSON it has
just printed. Neither status means clean, so `scripts/run_allium.py` runs the subcommand,
prints its output whole, and asserts what the contract says: an empty `diagnostics` array
and an empty `findings` array in every module. A diagnostic can be waived with a
whole-line `-- allium-ignore <code>` comment — the waiver terms are in
[Work with the specifications](../how-to/work-with-the-specs.md) — and a finding cannot.

The binary is a per-worktree install in a gitignored directory, so a worktree that has not
run `just initialize` fails `just lint` and `just check` until `just install-allium` puts
one there. That is accepted rather than softened: a gate that skips itself when its tool
is missing asserts nothing.

Only the four unix targets are supported. The release also carries a Windows zip; a target
nobody here runs would be a checksum nobody re-verifies.

## What would reopen this

Upstream publishing checksums for the platform binaries, which would remove the hand
computation. A distribution channel that a lockfile can name — which would also let
`just sync` install the checker, and so remove the one cost gating it imposed.
