# Repository map

The application sits at the repository root. There is no `frontend/` directory because
there is no backend to be a sibling of.

## What each part is responsible for

| Directory | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/lib/ports/` | The only place a browser global is touched. Each port exports an interface, a real adapter, and a fake. |
| `src/lib/brand.ts` | The one place this game's name is written; every component, story and test reads it from here. |
| `src/lib/` (the rest) | Pure behaviour this game adds, in directories of its own beside these. Given the same input it returns the same output, always. |
| `src/lib/components/` | Rendering and interaction. Components take callbacks as props and hold no application state of their own. |
| `src/routes/` | Assembling components into pages, and the only place a store is built. Prerendered, so nothing here may assume a request. |
| `tests/` | Vitest suites named for what they cover, not for the file they mirror. |
| `stories/` | Every state of a component, as something that can be looked at. Rendered in Chromium with axe over each. |
| `scripts/` | `validate_docs.py`, `validate_agents.py`, `run_project_check.py`, `run_ripsecrets_redacted.py`, `install_allium.py`, `run_allium.py`, `check_playwright_browsers.js`, and `initialize.sh`. |
| `docs/specs/` | The Allium specifications. Behaviour is decided here, not in code. |
| `.storybook/` | The workshop's configuration. Served locally, and built both by the gate, which discards it, and by `just chromatic`, which publishes it. |

Which of these may import which is not a matter of taste; see
[Layering and dependency direction](../explanation/layering.md).
