# The platform upstream

This game is one game on a platform, and the platform is a repository of its own:
[Biscuit Games](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games). Everything two games would
share is decided there and installed here. This page says what that covers, which version of
it is installed, what holds the two repositories to the same words, and where to read the
rest.

## What is decided there, and what is this game's

The platform decides how a Biscuit Games surface looks, how it is worked, and what it owes
when it is played on: the aesthetic, the Biscuit character, the design tokens and the two
typefaces, the shared components, the cell and the key a play surface is built from, the
preferences and keys ports, the design research, and the specifications for all of it.

This game decides its own rules and the specifications that state them; how its play surface
is arranged; what a mark means and the words it says about one; its data; and its address. A
component that encodes a rule or draws this game's own data stays here for that reason.

The question the boundary turns on is whether a second game would need the thing unchanged.
A cell is a cell in any game; how many of them, and in what arrangement, is this game's.

## What is installed

`@steven-cutting/biscuit-games` at the version `package.json` pins, exactly, from GitHub
Packages. Reading it needs a token — [Develop locally](../how-to/develop-locally.md) has the
line, and [Maintain dependencies](../how-to/maintain-dependencies.md) covers moving to a later
version.

The package carries the token stylesheet, the two typefaces, the icon set, the shared
components, the two ports with their fakes, the appearance derivations, three Allium modules
and its own changelog. All of it is readable offline once installed, under
`node_modules/@steven-cutting/biscuit-games/`, which is where the specifications
`tests/platformSpecs.test.ts` reads actually live.

## What holds the two together

Allium cannot import across repositories, and putting a module inside `node_modules` does not
give it one. So a game restates the clauses it needs and a test holds the restatements to the
platform's text. This game starts by restating none: `tests/restated.ts` is the table a
restated clause is entered in, and the six figures both sides declare — two contrast ratios,
the touch target, the narrowest width and the two separations — are held equal across the
shipped modules, `src/lib/config.ts` and the root module under `docs/specs/` by
`tests/platformSpecs.test.ts`. It is deliberately over-sensitive — a reworded comma fails it,
which is the one moment somebody is required to say whether the platform's meaning moved.
When it did, the clause is amended upstream and taken here as a version.

Everything else the platform decides arrives as code, so a change to it arrives as a version
bump that `just check` can see.

## Where to read it

The platform's handbook is published nowhere, so these are repository links. They resolve to
whole pages, never to a heading: nothing on either side checks a fragment across the
boundary.

| Page | What it decides |
| --- | --- |
| [What the hub owns](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/project/what-the-hub-owns.md) | The boundary itself, and the question a new fact is put to. |
| [Design direction](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/design/direction.md) | The aesthetic: dark first, the type, the density, the motion, the voice. |
| [The Biscuit character](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/design/character.md) | Biscuit herself, and how sparingly she is used. |
| [Design tokens](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/design/tokens.md) | What is in the stylesheet this game wears. |
| [Design resource index](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/design/resource-index.md) | The reading behind the vocabulary. |
| [Mobile and game design research](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/design/research-report.md) | The research report itself. |
| [Port a design system component](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/how-to/port-a-design-system-component.md) | How a component gets built there, and the ledger of what is left. |
| [Consume the hub](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/how-to/consume-the-hub.md) | The procedure a game follows to install the package; this one was rendered with it done. |
| [Published artefacts](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/reference/published-artefacts.md) | What the package contains, and what a version number promises. |
| [Poodl handover](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/operations/poodl-handover.md) | The ledger the first game worked through when it took the package, and what it still records. |
| [Architecture decisions](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/decisions/README.md) | Every decision made there, including the five below. |
| [Their decision 0012](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/decisions/0012-the-domain-root-stays-with-poodl.md) | Why the domain root is still Poodl's. |
| [Their decision 0013](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/decisions/0013-shared-material-travels-as-a-package.md) | Why shared material travels as a package. |
| [Their decision 0014](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/decisions/0014-the-hub-holds-the-design-system.md) | Why the design system's implementation moved there. |
| [Their decision 0015](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/decisions/0015-operation-and-play-are-specified-here.md) | Why operation and play are specified there. |
| [Their decision 0016](https://github.com/steven-cutting/biscuit_games/blob/main/docs/decisions/0016-the-play-surface-is-the-platforms.md) | Why the cell and the key are the platform's. |

The platform's and this game's records are numbered independently, so a bare number means
nothing without the repository. The ones above are all the platform's; this game's are
indexed in `docs/decisions/README.md`.

## What nothing here checks

Every link above is an `https://` URL, and the documentation contract skips those: the
exact-case, must-resolve rule that governs an internal link does not apply, and the offline
link checker passes `--offline`. Only `just check-links-online` resolves them, and it is run
by hand — monthly, per [Maintenance](../operations/maintenance.md).

So a page renamed upstream rots here until somebody runs it. That is permanent rather than a
gap somebody will close, and it is why these are whole-page links: a heading fragment across
the boundary is checked by nothing at all, on either side.
